# Palindrome Number Check
A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as it does forward. For example, the words "racecar" and "madam" are palindromes. Palindromes can also be numbers, such as 121 and 545.

This C program checks whether a given number is a palindrome. The program first prompts the user to enter a number. Then, it reverses the number and compares it to the original number. If the two numbers are the same, then the program prints The number is a palindrome. Otherwise, the program prints The number is not a palindrome.

- Prompt the user to enter a number.
